How much water use does the average Albuquerque water meter register per day? Does water usage change from season to season? 
What areas of town use the most water per meterâ€”and which areas of town have the most Advanced Metering Infrastructure
meters? Is it possible to tell which addresses are using sprinklers, when?

Using data made public via a public records request to the Albuquerque Water Utility Authority (WUA), this site aims to 
address these and related questions. Though the current dataset includes data from March 1, 2021 through June 27, 2021, 
I hope in time to expand the analysis contained herein to a larger dataset.
